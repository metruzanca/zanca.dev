## ðŸš€ Features ðŸš€

> For now this is acting as a personal todolist for the site

## Stuff To Do

### Gatsby TODO:

- [ ] RSS feed

### Netlify TODO:

- [ ] Site Map sent to google
  - Need to enable plugin for this.
- [ ] Backend analitics for popular pages / successful blog articles
- [ ] Form submissions

### General TODOs:

- [ ] Finish landing page, duh.
- [ ] Wakatime widget?
- [ ] Snazzy Work Experience section
- [ ] Even snazzier globe animation to show off work locations
- [ ] Pull github pinned projects for featured projects.
- [ ] Pull github repositories that have the repo.website is set to `https://zbest.dev/projects/name-of-repository` and generate a site page based on the repository.
  - Make a workflow for these repos where if their readme gets updated, this triggers a netlify rebuild via netlify build webhook.
- [ ] Special tags on projects for `Work related projets`. These would need to have their own site post probably as I can't make repos for these.
  - These should also show up in Work Experience.
- ~~Light Mode w/ toggle switch~~, no _light mode sucks_, dark mode forever!
- [ ] Particles on landing page hero section?
- [ ] Crossposting with syndication(_am i using this word right?_) linking back to website.

  - [Medium](http://Medium.com)
- [ ] Automatic Social Media posts with new blog articles
